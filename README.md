2) Single people performed well as compared to married and divorced people.
3) Development & Data Science have high performance as compared to other fields.
4) Finance Managers have low performance whereas business Analysts perform well.
5) Travelers rarely have low performance whereas non-travelers perform well.
6) People who did overtime, performed well.

## Bivariate Analysis of Numerical data:

1) People who have a long distance from the company performed low.
2) People who have high salary hikes performed well.
3) People who performed well, got promoted at an early stage.


## Why use Particular Machine Learning Models:

1) Decision trees are easy to interpret and visualize and give good transparency and understanding of the model.
2) Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions.
   This helps improve the model's generalization and reduces overfitting.
3) Gradient Boosting builds trees sequentially, with each tree correcting the errors of the previous ones.
   This sequential learning process often leads to high accuracy.

# Project Summary

The Data Science project which is given here is an analysis of employee performance from INX Furture Inc. The project goal is to find the performance rating of the employees from each feature of their data such as total work experience, gender, department, current role, etc. The Goals and Insights of the project are as follows:

*   Department wise performances
*   Top 3 Important Factors affecting employee performance
*   A trained model that can predict employee performance based on factors as inputs.
*   Recommendations to improve employee performance based on insights from analysis.
 
## Department wise performances

Employees of the Development and Data Science Department have a performance Rating compared to others.

..............

# Top 3 Important Factors affecting employee performance

## We Got three Most Important features from the Extra Tree Classifier are

*   EmpEnvironmentSatisfaction
*   EmpLastSalaryHikePercent
*   YearsSinceLastPromotion

.........

## A trained model that can predict employee performance based on factors as inputs.

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Gradient Boosting

.............

## Recommendations to improve employee performance based on insights from analysis.

1. Better Employee's work-life balance improves the performance rating.
2. The promotion will help the employees to achieve more responsible and leadership qualities.
3. Improve Work Environment for Better Performance of Employees.
4. Give good Salary Hike to Deserving Candidates for Better Performance.
5. The experience years in the current role need to be revised while offering employment to the new employees.
